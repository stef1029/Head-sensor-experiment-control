"""
This analysis script is in charge of taking the head sensor messages and syncing them up with the pulse times from the OEAB.
To do this, we first need to find all the pulse times on the appropriate channel, and then find the corresponding number message from the head sensor data.
I then want to save this data as a new dataset with the appropriate timings attached.
